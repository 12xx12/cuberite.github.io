<p>Public demo servers are available to test Cuberite's capabilities. Test servers are hosted in the US and EU and we recommend that you connect to the server closest to where you live - although for connections from Asia the EU server is likely faster.</p>

<p>The world is regularly reset on the test servers but you should be able to get a taste of what Cuberite is like, and set up your own in due course.</p>

<p>EU Server: eu.demo.cuberite.org<br>
US Server: us.demo.cuberite.org</p>
