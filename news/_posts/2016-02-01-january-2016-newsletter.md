Hi folks! This is the January 2016 edition of the Cuberite newsletter.

Last month has been all about the mobs and when it comes to mobs I mean
wolfs because wolf taming and protection works now in Cuberite thanks to
a lot of contributions from @LogicParrot. Also the naming conversion is
finally done thanks to contributions from @mathias-github.

We dropped the old MCServer forum in favor of a new, updated [forum](https://forum.cuberite.org) which has also finally https enabled. But don't worry, we saved all your
existing data and reimported it into the new forum. Now, you can find
any of our services under one domain.

We matched the design of the new forum to fit the design of most of our
services as well.
